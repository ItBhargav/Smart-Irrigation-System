# Smart-Irrigation-System
This smart irrigation system uses a soil moisture sensor to automate watering. When the soil is dry, it activates servoMotor1 to irrigate. When moisture is detected, servoMotor1 turns off, and servoMotor2 is activated to stop watering. This efficient system conserves water and maintains optimal soil moisture for crops.
